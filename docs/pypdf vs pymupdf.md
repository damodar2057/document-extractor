### ✅ **Summary: PyMuPDF vs PyPDF**

| Feature                          | **PyMuPDF (`fitz`)**                               | **PyPDF (`pypdf`)** |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Speed                            | ✅ Fast                                             | ❌ Slower            |
| Text Extraction                  | ✅ Layout-aware (preserves blocks, coordinates)     | ❌ Linear text only  |
| OCR Support                      | ✅ Works well with OCR (can render pages as images) | ❌ No OCR support    |
| Image Handling                   | ✅ Excellent                                        | ❌ Very limited      |
| PDF Editing (merge, split, sign) | ⚠️ Basic support                                   | ✅ Strong support    |
| Dependency                       | Requires native C lib (MuPDF)                      | Pure Python (no C)  |

### 🧠 **Recommendation**

Since you're building a **document extractor** for structured logistics PDFs like **load confirmations**, which may include:

* Tables
* Addresses
* Sections with clear layouts
* Possibly scanned or image-based documents

> 🔥 **Use `PyMuPDF` (i.e., `fitz`)** for:

* Accurate text extraction
* Preserving structure/layout
* Optional page rendering (for OCR with Tesseract)

If you ever need PDF manipulation like **merging, encrypting, or digital signing**, you can **supplement with `pypdf`**, but not for extraction.
